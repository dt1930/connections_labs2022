# A Webpage on the project FruitPluck


## A. Constructing a wireframe

The wireframe I came up with for this webpage is the first wireframe I ever made (after the one in the class). Making wireframes seemed like a journey to me 
because I was enjoying the process as well as experimenting with my creativity. I prepared around 3 rough wireframes for the assignment until I settled on the
one I have chosen here. The wireframe consists of a navigation bar at top, a wrapper at the middle that contains four sections, each of which has two blocks
to keep image and description except for the last two sections. The last two sections are gallery sections and video section. I also included a footer section
at the bottom of the page. Creating a wireframe was little messy first because I thought I was including more blocks or wrappers than needed. This is something
I tried to focus on - to reduce the number of unnecessary compartments. I hope my current wireframe is economical in that sense. **My wireframe is uploaded in
the folder HW1**.Overall, the process of constructing a wireframe was revealing of my design sense and creativity, which I feel will improve more as we progress 
with other projects.

## B. Coding the structure of the webpage/ writing html

I was already familiar with html, so this step wasn't new for me. I have cared about the naming of the classes, ids, block elements as I wrote the html file. I
did this part very quickly because the wireframe essentially corresponded to the div tags that I require to give structure to the page. I have used the following 
tags in my html file: heading tags (h3), link tags (a), image tags, div tags, video tag, p tag, ul and li tags along with the nav and section tags. Of all the steps
in the development of the webpage, this particular was the most seamless one. This process helped me understand the importance of wireframes in writing the html
for any webpage. 

## C. Working on the appearance of the webpage/ writing css

I have been exposed to very little CSS, so my one of the learning goals for the course was to be very good at CSS. Although I did some CSS before,the concepts 
related to padding, margin, position used to become confusing at times. The use of flexbox was a new CSS layout I did in this assignment for the first time. As I
used the flexfroggy website to look at various css properties, it became somehow easy to work with the properties. I also made the use of developer tools to check
if the width, margin, padding were as expected or not. It was very helpful in debugging why some div was not appearing as I want. 

I have used very plain and light colors that will give a sense of comfort to users. I have also made it accessible in terms of use of my colors as I have not used
many colors so as to camouflage the actual content. Instead, I have used a very light background (azure) so that any user can read the text/description of the 
project easily. Furthermore, I have positioned the navigation bar as sticky so that as the user scrolls down and wants to jump to certain parts of the webpage, 
he/she can do so without having to go the top of the webpage again. Meanwhile, the menus (About, Development, Gallery, Demo) are placed in the semantic order, and
these menus (links) are formatted in such a way that hovering over them will make them more prominent/conspicuous. All these features have been implemented with
a careful consideration of userfriendliness and accessibility. 

## D. Debugging, revisions of the code

I had to debug the CSS file quite often to give an appearance that I had in my mind. This meant changing things with the developer tools by inspecting the 
webpage. I also have paid attention to the naming of the classes, so I did few revisions of the code to make sure BEM naming conventions are used everywhere in the
code. I also used some comments in the CSS file and worked on spacing/indentation in both the files. To sum up, the code has been revised a couple of times before
submission.

## E. Self-evaluation of the final result

I have self-evaluated my final product, the webpage by talking about some of the strengths and weaknesses from my perspective.

      ### 1. Strengths
          a. It looks clean and elegant with a plain and comforting interface. 
          b. It is accessible in terms of navigation and color combinations.
          c. It is organized well semantically.
          
      ### 2. Weaknesses
          a. It is very simple and look effortless (I don't know if this is a good thing or not).
          b. It has very limited content.
          c. It could have been CSS heavy, but I wanted to keep it simple. The use of CSS is limited.
      
      
## F. Takeaways from the process
  
  1. I have learned how to make wireframes along with their importance in the process of web development.
  2. I have used flexbox layout in CSS, which is a new learning for me.
  3. I have started working with the inspect element option and developer tools more than before.
