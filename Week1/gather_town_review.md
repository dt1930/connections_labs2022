In my view, the main purpose of connected applications is, at the most fundamental level, to connect people. Furthermore, these applications should aim to build 
meaningful and purposeful connections. One of the applications that incorporates all of these features is gather town. Gather town seems very similar to zoom in 
the sense that both are web conferencing softwares, but it goes one step ahead in including the feature of virtual rooms/maps/spaces that makes it special. From 
online workshops to online dating and everything else, gather town can serve as a virtual space where participants can join in and feel connected. Unlike zoom
(maybe this is zoom fatigue creeping in), it has features that make you feel you are in the moment as you move around and interact with other participants just 
as you would do in real life. It might be an overstatement or a far-fetched prophecy to say that a virtual space will replace the whole world, but if it ever 
happens, I am sure it will look similar to gather town where people will have banks, houses, lands, and everything else that exists for real. It might sound
scary, but in some way, as a connected application developer, I would love to build an app similar to gather town that can connect people at that level.

Some of the aspects of gather town which could make it better might be instead of avatars if we could have, say, our face or our body like structure. Also, I might
be asking for more here but a 3-D rotation view feature would make it even more realistic. Apart from these things, I must say gather town is a totally rocking 
application with its features, such as assortment of various spaces, access controls, interactive objects, etc. I would love to build something like this for
my final project.
