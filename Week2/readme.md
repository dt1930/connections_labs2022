# A Webpage for weekly reminder


## A. Constructing a wireframe

I started by creating the wireframe for a mobile viewport, so all the block elements were positioned and structured keeping in mind that the webpage is going to be of certain dimensions on a mobile phone. My wireframe for the mobile device seemed satisfying, but I was still not sure how to structure the same page for a laptop, so I struggled and ended up with some changes in size but not the entire structure. Consequently, the web page looked ugly, but since the whole web page contains only the reminder thing, I thought it might be ok. I might resize and restructure the web page if I continue with this web page for my larger project.



## B. Coding the structure of the webpage/ writing html

I used the wireframe to write html and give structure to my webpage. BEM naming convention has been used to name all the classes in the html. Instead of input (text) used in the example in the lab session, I have tried to use textarea in my web page to provide more space for the user to enter a task or a reminder. One downside that some of my friends have pointed out is that they have to erase the entire text box before they can write what they want. I tried using the placeholder attribute so that it removes the instructions as soon as the user writes on the text area, but for some reason, it didn’t work. Since my final goal with this webpage is to build a weekly reminder application (for now), I will continuously work on this and come up with a way to fix this issue.

## C. Working on the appearance of the webpage/ writing css

I started working on CSS after completing the html. I gave a light blue background color and chose the font ‘Courier New’ to provide a cozy experience to the users. Although the larger the size of the buttons do seem jarring, when viewed in mobile browsers, the dimensions fit well. I have used flexbox to align the buttons. When hovering over the buttons, there is a change in background color and the text becomes bigger to support user accessibility. Since my major focus was on javascript for this assignment, the CSS aspect is quite limited.


## D. Working on the functionality of the web page/ writing .js

This is my first time working with javascript although I have done programming in python and C++. Javascript seemed similar to and even simpler than these programming languages in terms of syntax. I have utilized two things that we did in the classroom (counter and to-do list) into this web page. Furthermore, I have used loops and conditional statements to display the right buttons and hide others. One thing I wanted to do but couldn’t complete was using the bullet numbering to list items under the days buttons. I will work on this as I continue with the web page. I have changed the styling of different elements in the javascript to determine the behavior of the webpage as the user navigates the web page. Overall, I can safely say that I learned DOM manipulation through this assignment.

## E. Debugging, revisions of code
I did a good number of revisions to the code. Debugging in JS was made easy because of the console as I could check what’s wrong or what’s not working properly by using console log. Since I am planning to work on the same webpage further, I will revise the code. I did try to reduce the code repetitions in the .js file by using loops and functions.  To sum up, the code has been revised a couple of times, but I will be building on the same code as we move ahead.


## F. Self-evaluation of the final result

I have self-evaluated my final product, the webpage by talking about some of the strengths and weaknesses from my perspective.

      ### 1. Strengths
          a. It is meant to be a meaningful page. In fact, it is supposed to boost productivity, and my main purpose behind building this was to use it for myself
          as I don’t use google calendar that much. I wanted a digitized version of sticky notes. To some extent, the web page serves that purpose now, but many 
          features have to be incorporated to accomplish that goal.
          b. It includes all the materials we learned in the lab and some more.
          c. It is accessible in terms of color combinations and usability.
          
      ### 2. Weaknesses
          a. The laptop version of the web page seems too large and unnecessarily magnified. 
          b. The instructions in the text area don’t disappear automatically. The user has to delete the text.
          c. The notes are not bulleted under the days tabs.
      
      
## G. Takeaways from the process
  
  1. I have learned DOM manipulation and working with the console for debugging.
  2. I have learned how to handle event listeners and how to incorporate event-driven interactions in the web page.
