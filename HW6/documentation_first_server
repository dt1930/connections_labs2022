# A Node Express App serving a webpage

## A. Front-end part of the web
For the front-end, I have created a simple layout that contains an input-box where the user enters the name of the emirate and retrieves details about it. I have used a background image and heading with a white font to match the color combination. In the app.js file, I have fetched data from my own API about emirates. As soon as the user enters the name of an emirate, the information is displayed at the bottom of the page. I have also done error-checking so that if a name is entered that doesn’t refer to any emirate, there is a message of “sorry couldn’t find.” I have kept the front-end part plain as the back-end part was the priority for the assignment.

## B. Back-end part
First, I created my own API by looking at the data from wikipedia about the emirates. This is the API that is fetched in the web page from my server (localhost:8000/emirates). In the API, I have used both .params and query so that anyone who wants to access data from API can use the following queries and params to retrieve data:
http://localhost:8000/emirates: Retrieving data for all the emirates (this is used to fetch in the current web page)
http://localhost:8000/emirates?popGreaterThan=(required population) : Retrieving only those emirates which have population greater than a certain number
http://localhost:8000/emirates/(name of emirate) : Retrieving data only about that emirate

This was my second server after the one in the class. I enjoyed working in the back end, even more than the front-end. Maybe because I am using my device as both the client as well as the server at the same time, the purpose of the back end still seems not completely clear, but I appreciated having been able to create my own APIs that others can fetch.

## C.Working with code
I basically tried to imitate all the steps we did in the class and do it from scratch again. I have fetched the whole data set/ API in my web page although I have some queries to retrieve any specific data about a certain emirate or data based on some criteria, such as population. Working in the back end was relatively easy because of the class work. I am trying to fetch my project 1 web site, but I haven’t included it for this assignment here. I look forward to understanding the complete use of the server side as I move ahead in the course.

## D. Takeaways from the process
#### 1. I have learned how to create my own API and fetch it on my site.
#### 2. I have learned to use queries and params while creating APIs so that others can use them to retrieve specific data.
